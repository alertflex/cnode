The repository includes Alertflex controller source code, a common installation script and configs files for Alertflex central node, the MISP docker install script.

Alertflex works as a security event manager and implements the SOAR technology stack based on integration with third-party cybersecurity products (more than 20 are integrated at the moment).

Below a screenshot of the Alertflex management console demonstrates a dashboard for events that were collected by the Altprobe and Controller from security sensors.
