For working inside a distributed environment of Hybrid IT, the solution consists of separate software components Collector, Controller, Management Console. 
Alertflex Controller and Management Console build up the Central node. The Central node could be placed inside of monitored IT infrastructure or outside and can be scaled from the stand-alone appliance configuration to the microservices configuration.
